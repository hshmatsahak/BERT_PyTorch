Can't stop scrolling? Keep off your phone with the cutest focus timer, and unleash your productivity along with 6 million satisfied paying users.

🌟<b>Welcome to Forest, the place where procrastination does not exist!</b>🌟

Staying focused has never been harder in this world of digital distractions. From phone calls to text messages, your attention is constantly being diverted. 

Plant a tree when you need to stay focused. If you commit to your task without getting distracted, your tree grows; if you cannot resist the temptation to use your phone, your tree dies. Over time, you will have an entire forest built from your focus and commitment. 

<b>Free yourself from obsessive scrolling and achieve your goals!</b>

<b>GET MOTIVATED</b>💪
• Break phone addiction and form productive habits.
• Earn rewards by staying focused and unlock adorable trees!
• Grow your very own forest with each tree representing your efforts.
• View your daily/weekly/monthly/yearly progress and learn about your own focus habits.
• Concentrate on a daily routine and manage ADHD.

<b>FOCUS LIKE A PRO</b> ✍️ 
Activate Pro version and access more exciting features that will help you concentrate and procrastinate no more:

• Plant real trees on Earth with our partner, Trees for the Future - We've planted over 1,000,000 real trees so far!🌲
• Set up a customized allowlist - 
leaving Forest and using apps added to the allowlist will not kill your tree.
• Categorize your tasks with tags and see how you allocated your time.
• Track your phone usage and screen time.
• Compete with users around the world.
• Plant with friends - If one of you fail to stay focused, you'll all get a dead tree!

<b>Plant a tree and start building life-changing habits with Forest!</b>

NOTICE
• Forest is available for Android mobile and tablet devices, and can be accessed across all Android devices with Pro version. To download the non-Android version of Forest requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, your data can be synchronized across all platforms.

HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines<p></p>
» <b>Fully Customisable</b>
Measure and track anything and everything. Follow your own schedule and track your own goals. Get notified whenever you need to do something important.<p></p>
» <b>Cut Bad Habits From Your Life</b>
Simply start tracking bad habits like nail biting, smoking or drinking too much. Once you see the patterns, it's easier to break them. HabitBull keeps you accountable. Also great for users of NoFap!<p></p>
» <b>Add Some Positive Habits</b>
Want to go for a nice walk every day? Or maybe give 3 hugs every Saturday and Sunday? Join us on this journey!<p></p>
» <b>Who is it for?</b>
Whether you want to read some more, stop smoking, start working out or even just track how many hours you wasted on Facebook, this app lets you do it!<p></p>
» <b>Features</b>
•  Track multiple habits, repeated to do's or goals, each in its own calendar
•  Streak counter and percentage successful for each habit
•  Yes/No or Number goals
•  Very flexible goals like: number of times per day/week/month, only on certain days of the week etc. For example: 30 push ups every Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 times per week, or even every 2 days
•  Inspiring quotes per category - including actual quotes from people doing it (meditation, reading, stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking cigarettes, stop procrastination etc)

•  Home screen / lock screen widget
•  Multi-device syncing
•  Cloud backup
•  Motivational images
•  Export to CSV
•  Dark theme
•  Google Fit integration<p></p>
» <b>How it works:</b>
1. Set up a habit
2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day
3. Watch your daily streak increase<p></p>
Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.<p></p>
To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).<p></p>
HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.<p></p>
There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.
It is entirely up to you, really. But why not give it a try and have a convenient helper on the go?<p></p>","» <b>Organize Your Life!</b><br>HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines<p></p><br>» <b>Fully Customisable</b><br>Measure and track anything and everything.

Sectograph. Planner & Time manager on clock widget,"<b>Sectograph</b> is a <i>time planner</i> that visually displays a list of tasks and events for the day in the form of a <i>12-hour pie chart</i> - a watch dial.
The application will help you <u>sharpen your sense of time</u> and <u>allow you to visualize your day</u>.

<b>HOW IT WORKS</b>

In short, it is a projection of your routine and tasks onto the clock face. It visualizes your day for precise timekeeping and offers you peace of mind.
The scheduler works like an analog clock face. It automatically fetches all the events from your Google calendar (or local calendar) and places them on a 12-hour sectored watch face. This technology can be called a ""Calendar clock"".

<b>HOW IT LOOKS</b>

The list of your calendar events is projected in the form of a pie chart in the application and on the home screen widget.
Events are sectors, the beginning and duration of which you can clearly track using special arcs to follow your plan.
A calendar and analog clock combined gives you an amazingly visual representation of your work, allowing you to effectively plan and calculate your day.

<b>WHAT CAN THE APPLICATION BE USED FOR?</b>

✔ Daily scheduling and visual timing. Track your daily tasks, agendas, appointments, and events in Sectograph, and at any time, find out how much time is left until the end of the current event and the start of the next one. Don't be late.
✔ Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in the docking station at your workstation and your office day plan is under control.
✔ Schedule of classes. Keep your phone close at hand and see how much time is left until the end of those tiring lectures – and never be late for lab work again.
✔ Self-organization at home. Your daily routine is now more convenient than ever. Remember to balance work, rest and physical activity, just use the app as an organizer for your home routine.
✔ Trip timer and flight duration. Do you lose track of time due to endless travel and flights? Visually control your check-in, landing and flight duration. Keep everything under control.
✔ Follow your meal schedule, medication schedule, exercise therapy, and other important activities. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!
✔ Convenient countdown of any lengthy scheduled events. Don't miss the end of your vacation and know exactly how many days are left until the end of your military service.
✔ Monitor everyday affairs on the go and in your car. Achieve your goals by keeping the application installed on the device.
✔ Time management using GTD technology. Is planning your day confusing? With the function of striking out or hiding flagged events, keep your chart as clean as possible. Sectograph will improve your time management.
✔ My goals. The app can be used to achieve goals from your Google calendar. It will help you with timekeeping, organize your day, and assist you in completing your goals on time.
✔ Attention-deficit. According to our users, the application is effective for attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD). If you are wasting time and have trouble concentrating on tasks, this app may be useful to you.
✔ The application will be useful for fans of the ""Chronodex"" concept. You can use the Sectograph as an analog of a paper diary used by this concept.
✔ Display doings from Microsoft Outlook calendar. (beta)
